"""Application state initialisation helpers for :class:`AutoMLApp`.

The :class:`AppInitializer` concentrates the large collection of lists,
probability tables and other default state values required by
``AutoMLApp``.  Separating this logic keeps ``AutoMLApp.__init__``
focused on orchestrating high-level services and UI configuration.
