# AutoML

AutoML is an automotive modeling and analysis tool built around a SysML-based metamodel. It lets you describe items, operating scenarios, functions, structure and interfaces in a single environment.

Project configuration is handled by the new **ProjectPropertiesManager** module, centralising probability tables and other project properties.

The metamodel blends concepts from key automotive standards—ISO 26262 (functional safety), ISO 21448 (SOTIF), ISO 21434 (cybersecurity) and ISO 8800 (safety and AI)—so one project can address safety, cybersecurity and assurance requirements side by side.

Diagram drawing is centralised in a dedicated :class:`DiagramRenderer`, providing a clear interface for generating and exporting diagrams.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install pillow openpyxl networkx matplotlib reportlab adjustText
   ```
2. **Launch AutoML**
   ```bash
   python automl.py
   ```
3. **Create a new project**
   - Choose **File → New Project** from the menu.
   - Use the diagrams and analysis tools to build your model.

These steps start the application with an empty project so you can explore the workflow described in later sections.

## Governance Diagrams

Governance diagrams map the lifecycle of an item to the standards it must
comply with so teams can see when each guideline applies. To build one in
AutoML:

1. **List the standards** that govern the item (e.g. ISO 26262, ISO 21448,
   ISO 21434, ISO 8800). Capture their key milestones, work products and
   review gates.
2. **Define lifecycle states** for the item such as concept, development,
   production and operation. For each state note the required evidence and
   decision points drawn from the standards.
3. **Create a diagram** that lays out the lifecycle states as nodes. Connect
   them with transitions that reflect progression or feedback. Use
   stereotypes or color coding to highlight which standard drives each state
   and to show shared activities across standards. Select process areas or
   work products from the governance panel and click in the diagram to place
   them where they belong.
4. **Tailor the flow** by adding optional branches or conditional steps when
   a standard allows alternative approaches. Document rationale for each
   tailoring so audits can trace the decision.
5. **Iterate** as the project evolves. Update the diagram when standards or
   lifecycle plans change so it remains a current view of governance.

These diagrams provide a single reference for planning work products,
coordinating reviews and communicating how safety, cybersecurity and AI
assurance fit together across the item’s lifecycle.

Governance diagrams can also produce **derived requirements**.  Each task,
flow and relationship—including any optional conditions or labels—is
converted into a natural language statement so governance models can be
exported as concise requirements lists.

When editing a governance diagram in the Safety & Security Management tool,
use the **Requirements** button to generate these statements and view them in
a new tab within the working area.

For example, the snippet below creates a tiny governance diagram and prints
its derived requirements:

```python
from analysis.governance import GovernanceDiagram

diagram = GovernanceDiagram()
diagram.add_task("Draft Plan")
diagram.add_task("Review Plan")
diagram.add_flow("Draft Plan", "Review Plan", condition="plan complete")
diagram.add_relationship(
    "Review Plan", "Draft Plan", condition="changes requested", label="rework"
)

for req in diagram.generate_requirements():
    print(req)
```

Running this script produces:

```
The system shall perform task 'Draft Plan'.
The system shall perform task 'Review Plan'.
When plan complete, task 'Draft Plan' shall precede task 'Review Plan'.
Task 'Review Plan' shall rework task 'Draft Plan' when changes requested.
```

To gather the requirements for every governance diagram within a specific lifecycle phase,
use the Safety & Security Management tool's *Phase Requirements* menu or call the helper
directly:

```python
from analysis import SafetyManagementToolbox
from gui.safety_management_toolbox import SafetyManagementWindow

toolbox = SafetyManagementToolbox()
# diagrams would normally be created and assigned to a phase here
window = SafetyManagementWindow(None, app=None, toolbox=toolbox)
window.generate_phase_requirements("Concept")  # collects all Concept phase requirements
```

This opens a tab listing the combined requirements for the chosen phase, and
now includes a dedicated column displaying the lifecycle phase for each
requirement.

When importing governance diagrams from a SysML repository, every diagram object
is treated as a task regardless of its type. Custom elements such as ANN or
AI Database nodes therefore participate in requirement generation:

```python
from mainappsrc.models.sysml.sysml_repository import SysMLRepository
from analysis.governance import GovernanceDiagram

repo = SysMLRepository()
diag = repo.create_diagram("Governance Diagram", name="Train")
ann = repo.create_element("ANN", name="ANN1")
gate = repo.create_element("Decision", name="Gate")
diag.objects = [
    {"obj_id": 1, "obj_type": "ANN", "element_id": ann.elem_id, "properties": {}},
    {"obj_id": 2, "obj_type": "Decision", "element_id": gate.elem_id, "properties": {}},
]
diag.connections = [
    {"src": 2, "dst": 1, "conn_type": "AI training", "name": "data ready", "properties": {}}
]

gov = GovernanceDiagram.from_repository(repo, diag.diag_id)
for req in gov.generate_requirements():
    print(req)
```

The output includes the relationship requirement:

```
The system shall perform task 'ANN1'.
The system shall perform task 'Gate'.
Task 'Gate' shall be related to task 'ANN1' when data ready.
```

To gather the requirements for every governance diagram within a specific lifecycle phase,
use the Safety & Security Management tool's *Phase Requirements* menu or call the helper
directly:

```python
from analysis import SafetyManagementToolbox
from gui.safety_management_toolbox import SafetyManagementWindow

toolbox = SafetyManagementToolbox()
# diagrams would normally be created and assigned to a phase here
window = SafetyManagementWindow(None, app=None, toolbox=toolbox)
window.generate_phase_requirements("Concept")  # collects all Concept phase requirements
```

This opens a tab listing the combined requirements for the chosen phase.

When importing governance diagrams from a SysML repository, every diagram object
is treated as a task regardless of its type. Custom elements such as ANN or
AI Database nodes therefore participate in requirement generation:

```python
from mainappsrc.models.sysml.sysml_repository import SysMLRepository
from analysis.governance import GovernanceDiagram

repo = SysMLRepository()
diag = repo.create_diagram("Governance Diagram", name="Train")
ann = repo.create_element("ANN", name="ANN1")
gate = repo.create_element("Decision", name="Gate")
diag.objects = [
    {"obj_id": 1, "obj_type": "ANN", "element_id": ann.elem_id, "properties": {}},
    {"obj_id": 2, "obj_type": "Decision", "element_id": gate.elem_id, "properties": {}},
]
diag.connections = [
    {"src": 2, "dst": 1, "conn_type": "AI training", "name": "data ready", "properties": {}}
]

gov = GovernanceDiagram.from_repository(repo, diag.diag_id)
for req in gov.generate_requirements():
    print(req)
```

The output includes the relationship requirement:

```
The system shall perform task 'ANN1'.
The system shall perform task 'Gate'.
Task 'Gate' shall be related to task 'ANN1' when data ready.
```

## Workflow Overview

The diagram below illustrates how information flows through the major work products. Each box lists the main inputs and outputs so you can see how analyses feed into one another and where the review workflow fits. Approved reviews update the ASIL and CAL values propagated throughout the model.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph ext [External inputs]
        X([BOM])
    end
    X --> R([Reliability analysis<br/>inputs: BOM<br/>outputs: FIT rates & parts])
    A([System functions & architecture]) --> B([HAZOP<br/>inputs: functions<br/>outputs: malfunctions])
    A --> S([FI2TC / TC2FI<br/>inputs: functions<br/>outputs: hazards, FIs & TCs, severity])
    A --> T([Threat Analysis<br/>inputs: architecture & functions<br/>outputs: threat scenarios])
    B --> C([Risk Assessment<br/>inputs: malfunctions, SOTIF severity & cyber risk<br/>outputs: hazards, ASIL, safety goals])
    S --> C
    T --> U([Cyber Risk Assessment<br/>inputs: threat scenarios<br/>outputs: damage scenarios, CAL, cybersecurity goals])
    U --> C
    A --> D([FMEA / FMEDA<br/>inputs: architecture, malfunctions, reliability<br/>outputs: failure modes])
    R --> D
    C --> D
    C --> E([FTA<br/>inputs: hazards & safety goals<br/>outputs: fault trees])
    D --> E
    U --> V([Cybersecurity requirements<br/>inputs: cybersecurity goals])
    E --> F([Safety requirements<br/>inputs: fault trees & failure modes])
    F & V --> G([Peer/Joint review<br/>inputs: requirements & analyses<br/>outputs: approved changes])
    G --> H([ASIL & CAL propagation to SGs, CGs, FMEAs and FTAs])
```

The workflow begins by entering system functions and architecture elements. A **BOM** is imported into a **Reliability analysis** which produces FIT rates and component lists used by the **FMEA/FMEDA** tables. A **HAZOP** analysis identifies malfunctions while the **FI2TC/TC2FI** tables capture SOTIF hazards, functional insufficiencies and triggering conditions along with their severities. In parallel, a **Threat Analysis** maps potential attack paths so the **Cyber Risk Assessment** can compute damage scenarios, risk levels and CALs. Those cybersecurity results feed the **risk assessment**, which combines them with malfunctions and SOTIF severities to assign hazards and ASIL ratings to safety goals that then inform FMEDAs and **FTA** diagrams. Cyber and safety goals produce corresponding requirement sets that converge in peer or joint **reviews**. When a review is approved any changes to requirements or analyses automatically update the ASIL and CAL values traced back to the safety goals, cybersecurity goals, FMEAs and FTAs.

## Pegasus Scenario Generation

AutoML can autogenerate traffic scenarios using the PEGASUS methodology to ensure standardized and comprehensive coverage of operating conditions. The tool interprets ODD parameters and variation dimensions to build scenario libraries consumed by HAZOP, risk assessments and other analyses. Learn more about the approach in the [PEGASUS project](https://www.pegasusprojekt.de/en/about-PEGASUS).

## HAZOP Analysis

The **HAZOP Analysis** window lets you list system functions with one or more associated malfunctions. Each entry records the malfunction guideword (*No/Not*, *Unintended*, *Excessive*, *Insufficient* or *Reverse*), the related scenario, driving conditions and hazard, and whether it is safety relevant. Covered malfunctions may reference other entries as mitigation. When a function is allocated to an active component in a reliability analysis, its malfunctions become selectable failure modes in the FMEDA table.

## Risk Assessment

The **Risk Assessment** view builds on the safety relevant malfunctions from a selected HAZOP. When creating a new assessment you pick a HAZOP document from a drop-down; only malfunctions from that selection appear in the table. Each assessment table contains the following columns:

1. **Malfunction** – combo box listing malfunctions flagged as safety relevant in the chosen HAZOP document.
2. **Hazard** – textual description of the resulting hazard.
3. **Severity** – ISO&nbsp;26262 severity level (1–3). Values from FI2TC and
   TC2FI analyses are inherited here so the risk assessment reflects SOTIF hazards.
4. **Severity Rationale** – free text explanation for the chosen severity.
5. **Controllability** – ISO&nbsp;26262 controllability level (1–3).
6. **Controllability Rationale** – free text explanation for the chosen controllability.
7. **Exposure** – ISO&nbsp;26262 exposure level (1–4).
8. **Exposure Rationale** – free text explanation for the chosen exposure.
9. **ASIL** – automatically calculated from severity, controllability and exposure using the ISO&nbsp;26262 risk graph.
10. **Safety Goal** – combo box listing all defined safety goals in the project.
11. **Cyber Risk** – optional link to a cyber risk assessment entry so damage scenarios and CALs influence the hazard evaluation.

If a cyber risk entry is selected, its damage scenario and CAL are stored with the row for traceability to cybersecurity goals. The calculated ASIL from each row is propagated to the referenced safety goal so that inherited ASIL levels appear consistently in all analyses and documentation, including FTA top level events.

 The **Hazard Explorer** tab lists all hazards from every risk assessment in a read-only table for quick review or CSV export. A **Requirements Explorer** window lets you query global requirements with filters for text, type, ASIL and status.

## Causal Bayesian Network Analysis

The **Causal Bayesian Network** editor models causal relationships between binary variables and supports classic probability queries alongside `do`-style interventions. Add variables with the **Variable** tool, connect them with directed edges and enter prior or conditional probabilities in the table beneath the diagram. Queries can be run with observational evidence or by forcing interventions on selected variables.

```python
from analysis import CausalBayesianNetwork
cbn = CausalBayesianNetwork()
cbn.add_node("Rain", cpd=0.3)
cbn.add_node("WetGround", parents=["Rain"], cpd={(True,): 0.9, (False,): 0.1})
cbn.add_node("SlipperyRoad", parents=["WetGround"], cpd={(True,): 0.8, (False,): 0.05})
cbn.query("SlipperyRoad")
cbn.intervention("SlipperyRoad", {"Rain": True})
```

## Requirements Creation and Management

Safety requirements are defined directly on FTA nodes and FMEA entries. In the edit dialog for a node or table row use **Add New** to create a fresh requirement or **Add Existing** to reuse one from the global registry. A new requirement records an ID, type (vehicle, operational, functional safety, technical safety, AI safety, functional modification, cybersecurity, production, service, product or legal) with ASIL and CAL values where applicable. Operational, functional modification, production, service, product and legal requirements omit ASIL and CAL. Requirements can be split into two with the **Decompose** button which assigns ASIL values according to ISO 26262 decomposition rules. All requirements are stored in a project-wide list so they can be attached to multiple elements.

Open the **Requirements Matrix** from the Requirements menu to see every requirement with its allocation to basic events and any traced safety goals. The matrix view links to a **Requirements Editor** where you can add, edit or delete entries and modify traceability. Requirement statuses automatically change from draft to *in review*, *peer reviewed*, *pending approval* and finally *approved* as associated reviews progress. Updating a requirement reopens affected reviews so feedback is always tracked against the latest version.

## AutoML Diagrams and Safety Analyses

Use case, activity, block and internal block diagrams can be created from the **Architecture** menu. Diagrams are stored inside a built-in SysML repository and appear in the *Analyses* explorer under *System Design (Item Definition)* so they can be reopened alongside safety documents. Each object keeps its saved size and properties so layouts remain stable when returning to the project.

The new :class:`SafetyAnalysis_FTA_FMEA` facade combines previously separate
fault-tree, FMEA and FMEDA helpers into a single interface, simplifying how the
application orchestrates safety analyses.

Activity diagrams list individual **actions** that describe the expected behavior for a block. These actions can be referenced directly in HAZOP tables as potential malfunctions. When a block is linked to a reliability analysis, any actions in its internal block diagram are inherited as additional failure modes for that analysis. The inherited actions automatically show up in new FMEDA tables along with the failure modes already defined for the analysis components.

Elements on a diagram may reference reliability analyses. Choosing an **analysis** or **component** automatically fills the **fit**, **qualification** and **failureModes** fields using data from FMEA and FMEDA tables. These values show up in a *Reliability* compartment for blocks or below parts. When a block references an analysis, the components from that analysis BOM can be inserted as parts in the linked internal block diagram with their failure modes already listed.

Requirements can also be attached to diagram elements to keep architecture and safety analyses synchronized. The same safety goals referenced in HAZOP or risk assessment tables can therefore be traced directly to the blocks and parts that implement them.

## Metamodel Overview

The AutoML metamodel extends SysML with safety, SOTIF, cybersecurity and reliability constructs. By embedding concepts from ISO 26262, ISO 21448, ISO 21434 and ISO 8800 directly into the language, it provides a unified foundation for analyses across disciplines.

Internally, AutoML stores all model elements inside a lightweight SysML repository. Each element is saved with its specific type—`BlockUsage`, `PartUsage`, `PortUsage`, `ActivityUsage`, `ActionUsage`, `UseCase`, `Actor` and so on. Links between these typed elements use the `SysMLRelationship` class. Diagrams such as use case or block diagrams are stored as `SysMLDiagram` objects containing the drawn **objects** and their **connections**. The singleton `SysMLRepository` manages every element, relationship, diagram and review so analyses stay consistent across the application. Each element ID is listed in an `element_diagrams` mapping so name or property updates propagate to every diagram where that element appears.

Every element, relationship and diagram records creation and modification metadata such as the author, email and timestamps. Blocks and parts expose additional reliability fields (`analysis`, `fit`, `qualification` and `failureModes`, plus `component` and `asil` on parts) so architecture elements remain linked to safety analyses.

```

### AutoML Safety Extensions

AutoML builds on this base by introducing domain specific stereotypes for safety
analysis. Hazards, faults and scenarios are stored using explicit types such as
`Hazard`, `Scenario`, `Scenery`, `SafetyGoal` and `FaultTreeNode`. Tables like
HAZOP or risk assessment reference these elements so analyses remain linked to the
architecture.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class SafetyGoal
    class Hazard
    class Scenario
    class Scenery
    class FaultTreeNode
    class Fault
    class Failure
    class FmedaDoc
    class FmeaDoc
    class FaultTreeDiagram
    class TriggeringCondition
    class FunctionalInsufficiency
    class FunctionalModification
    class AcceptanceCriteria
    SafetyGoal --> "*" Hazard : mitigates
    Scenario --> "*" Hazard : leadsTo
    Scenario --> Scenery : occursIn
    Scenario --> TriggeringCondition : has
    Scenario --> FunctionalInsufficiency : reveals
    TriggeringCondition --> FunctionalInsufficiency : leadsTo
    FunctionalInsufficiency --> FunctionalModification : mitigatedBy
    FunctionalModification --> AcceptanceCriteria : verifiedBy
    Fault --> Failure : leadsTo
    FmeaDoc --> Fault : records
    FmeaDoc --> Failure : records
    FaultTreeNode --> Failure : baseEvent
    FaultTreeNode --> "*" SafetyGoal : traces
    FaultTreeDiagram --> "*" FaultTreeNode : contains
    FaultTreeDiagram --> FmeaDoc : uses
    FaultTreeDiagram --> FmedaDoc : uses
```

### Core SysML Elements

The repository tracks each element by its specific type rather than using the
generic `SysMLElement` placeholder. Key classes include:

- **BlockUsage** – structural block definition. Properties: `partProperties`,
  `ports`, `operations`, plus reliability attributes `analysis`, `fit`,
  `qualification` and `failureModes`.
- **PartUsage** – internal part with `component`, `failureModes` and `asil`
  fields for BOM links and safety ratings.
  Parts created automatically for composite aggregations set a `force_ibd`
  property so an internal block diagram is generated when the block structure is
  first opened.
- **PortUsage** – port on a block or part. Provides `direction`, `flow`,
  `labelX` and `labelY` to specify connector orientation.
- **ActivityUsage** – container for behaviors with `ownedActions` and
  `parameters`.
- **ActionUsage** – atomic step within an activity. Can be specialized as
  `CallBehaviorAction` to invoke another activity.
- **ControlFlow** and **ObjectFlow** – edges between actions. Control flows
  handle sequencing while object flows carry typed data.
- **Use Case** and **Actor** – high level functional views capturing external
  interactions.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class BlockUsage
    class PartUsage
    class PortUsage
    class ActivityUsage
    class ActionUsage
    class ControlFlow
    class ObjectFlow
    class UseCase
    class Actor
    BlockUsage "1" o-- "*" PartUsage : parts
    BlockUsage --> "*" PortUsage : ports
    BlockUsage --> "*" ActivityUsage : behaviors
    PartUsage --> "*" PortUsage : ports
    ActivityUsage --> "*" ActionUsage : actions
    ActionUsage --> "*" ControlFlow : control
    ActionUsage --> "*" ObjectFlow : objects
    UseCase --> "*" Actor : actors
    UseCase --> ActivityUsage : realizedBy
```

### Diagram Relationships

Internal block diagrams provide structural views of a block. The diagram displays the block's parts and their ports so connectors can be drawn between them. Actions in activity diagrams may also reference an internal block diagram that explains the hardware interaction for that step.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class BlockUsage
    class PartUsage
    class PortUsage
    class SysMLDiagram
    class InternalBlockDiagram
    class ActionUsage
    SysMLDiagram <|-- InternalBlockDiagram
    BlockUsage --> InternalBlockDiagram : structureView
    InternalBlockDiagram --> "*" PartUsage : shows
    InternalBlockDiagram --> "*" PortUsage : ports
    PartUsage --> "*" PortUsage : ports
    ActionUsage --> InternalBlockDiagram : view
```

### Detailed Safety, Reliability and Cybersecurity Metamodel

The tool stores each safety analysis in its own container object alongside the
SysML repository. These containers track the tables and diagrams loaded in the
GUI so analyses remain linked to the architecture. Key data classes include:

`ReliabilityAnalysis` records the selected standard, mission profile and overall
FIT results. Each `ReliabilityComponent` lists attributes like qualification,
quantity and a dictionary of part‑specific parameters. `MissionProfile`
instances capture on/off times and temperature ranges used when converting FIT
rates to probabilities. `MechanismLibrary` collections hold
`DiagnosticMechanism` entries from ISO 26262 Annex D so FMEDAs can select the
appropriate diagnostic coverage. `ScenarioLibrary` and `OddLibrary` objects
group reusable scenarios and ODD elements so HAZOP, risk assessment and FI2TC/TC2FI tables
share a consistent context. HAZOP and risk assessment tables use `HazopDoc`/`HazopEntry`
and `HaraDoc`/`HaraEntry` pairs to store their rows. FMEA and FMEDA tables are
stored as `FmeaDoc` and `FmedaDoc` with lists of generic `FmeaEntry`
dictionaries capturing the failure mode, cause, detection rating and diagnostic
coverage. Causal Bayesian Network analyses use `CausalBayesianNetworkDoc` containers that pair a network with its diagram layout so probabilistic models can be edited alongside other work products. Fault tree diagrams consist of nested `FaultTreeNode` objects that hold
FMEA metrics, FMEDA values and traced requirements. Cybersecurity analyses use
`ThreatDoc` and `CyberRiskEntry` records to capture STRIDE-based threat
scenarios, attack paths and damage assessments. Each `CyberRiskEntry`
computes impact, risk level and CAL while linked `CybersecurityGoal`
collections store the highest resulting CAL to support ISO 21434 compliance.

The diagram below shows how a threat analysis links to its cybersecurity risk
assessment and resulting goal. Each risk entry records the attack vector,
feasibility and four impact categories before deriving the overall impact,
resulting risk level and Cybersecurity Assurance Level (CAL).

#### Analysis Relationships

The diagram below shows how reliability calculations flow into FMEDA tables and fault trees.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class BlockUsage
    class PartUsage
    class HazopEntry
    class FmeaDoc
    class FaultTreeDiagram
    class Fault
    class Failure
    class FmeaEntry
    class FmedaDoc
    class ReliabilityAnalysis
    class ReliabilityComponent
    BlockUsage --> ReliabilityAnalysis : analysis
    ReliabilityAnalysis --> "*" ReliabilityComponent : components
    PartUsage --> ReliabilityComponent : component
    HazopEntry --> FmeaEntry : failureMode
    FmeaDoc --> "*" FmeaEntry : rows
    FmeaEntry --> Fault : cause
    FmeaEntry --> Failure : effect
    Failure --> FaultTreeNode : event
    FmedaDoc --> "*" FmeaEntry : rows
    PartUsage --> "*" FmeaEntry : failureModes
    ReliabilityComponent --> "*" FmeaEntry : modes
    FmeaEntry --> FaultTreeNode : baseEvent
    SysMLDiagram <|-- FaultTreeDiagram
    FaultTreeDiagram --> "*" FaultTreeNode : nodes
```

Blocks reference a `ReliabilityAnalysis` which lists its components. Parts link directly to the matching `ReliabilityComponent`. Malfunctions selected from `HazopEntry` rows become `FmeaEntry` failure modes tied to those components. The base FIT for each `ReliabilityComponent` feeds into FMEDA tables so a separate FIT is calculated for every failure mode. These FMEDA entries can spawn `FaultTreeNode` base events inside an FTA diagram so probabilities and coverage remain synchronized with the reliability analysis.

#### Hazard Traceability

The next diagram traces how malfunctions detected in a HAZOP flow through the safety analyses. Actions in activity diagrams become `HazopEntry` malfunctions linked to operational `Scenario` objects and their `Scenery` from the ODD. Selected HAZOP rows populate `HaraEntry` items where Severity × Exposure × Controllability determine the ASIL and resulting `SafetyGoal`. When cyber risks are relevant, each `HaraEntry` can reference a `CyberRiskEntry` so damage scenarios influence the hazard analysis. Safety goals appear as the top level events in FTAs. FMEDA failure modes and architecture components create `FaultTreeNode` base events that generate safety `Requirement` objects. Requirements may be decomposed into children with reduced ASIL values when ISO 26262 decomposition rules apply.

the names or IDs of the analyses being evaluated.

## BOM Integration with AutoML Diagrams

Blocks in block diagrams may reference saved reliability analyses via the **analysis** property while parts reference individual components using the **component** property. Both element types also provide **fit**, **qualification** and **failureModes** attributes. Entering values for these fields shows them in a *Reliability* compartment for blocks or as additional lines beneath parts so FIT rates and qualification information remain visible in the AutoML model. When editing a block or part you can now pick from drop-down lists containing all analyses or components from saved reliability analyses. Selecting an item automatically fills in its FIT rate, qualification certificate and any failure modes found in FMEA tables.

## Component Qualifications

Reliability calculations take the qualification certificate of each passive component into account. When computing FIT rates, a multiplier based on the certificate (e.g. *AEC‑Q200* or *MIL‑STD‑883*) is applied so qualified parts yield lower failure rates. Active components currently use a neutral factor. Additional datasheet parameters such as diode forward voltage or MOSFET `RDS(on)` can be entered when configuring components to better document the parts used in the analysis.

## Mission Profiles and Probability Formulas

The **Reliability** menu lets you define mission profiles describing the on/off time, temperatures and other conditions for your system. When a profile is present its total `TAU` value is used to convert FIT rates into failure probabilities for each basic event.

In the *Edit Node* dialog for a basic event you can choose how the FIT rate is interpreted:

* **linear** – probability is calculated as `λ × τ` where `λ` is the FIT value expressed as failures per hour and `τ` comes from the selected mission profile.
* **exponential** – uses the exponential model `1 − exp(−λ × τ)`.
* **constant** – probability comes from the basic event's *Failure Probability* field and does not use the FIT rate or mission time.

Mission profiles and the selected formula for each basic event are stored in the JSON model so results remain consistent when reloading the file.

## SOTIF Analysis

The **Qualitative Analysis** menu also provides dedicated SOTIF tools. Selecting **Triggering Conditions** or **Functional Insufficiencies** opens read-only lists of each node type with an **Export CSV** button. These views gather all triggering condition and functional insufficiency nodes from the FTAs so the information can be reviewed separately.

Two additional tables support tracing between these elements:

* **FI2TC Analysis** – analogue of HAZOP for SOTIF. Each row links a functional
  insufficiency to the triggering conditions, scenarios and mitigation measures
  that reveal the hazard. The hazard and its **severity** are recorded here. The
  table includes dedicated **triggering_conditions** and
  **functional_insufficiencies** columns populated via comboboxes so new items
  can be added on the fly. The **design_measures** column now shows a list of
  allocated functional modification requirements with **Add New** and
  **Add Existing** buttons just like FTA nodes. Selected requirements appear in
  the listbox and can be edited or removed individually.
* **TC2FI Analysis** – also mirrors HAZOP concepts for SOTIF. It starts from the
  triggering condition and lists the impacted functions, architecture elements
  and related insufficiencies. The identified hazard and its **severity** are
  noted in each entry. The **triggering_conditions** and
  **functional_insufficiencies** fields mirror those in the FI2TC table to keep
  the relationships consistent.

Severity recorded in FI2TC and TC2FI entries is inherited by the risk assessment so the risk graph reflects the SOTIF findings. Other risk assessment values such as the associated safety goal flow into these tables so SOTIF considerations remain connected to the overall risk assessment. Minimal cut sets calculated from the FTAs highlight combinations of FIs and TCs that form *CTAs*. From a CTA entry you can generate a functional modification requirement describing how the design must change to avoid the unsafe behaviour.

All FI2TC and TC2FI documents appear in the *Hazard Analysis* section of the **Analyses** tab so they can be opened alongside risk assessment tables, FTAs and CTAs for a complete view of functional safety and SOTIF issues.

### SOTIF Traceability

The following diagram shows how triggering conditions, functional insufficiencies and functional modifications connect scenarios to safety goals and fault trees. FI2TC and TC2FI tables cross‑reference these elements and record the acceptance criteria for each mitigation.

## Cybersecurity Analysis

AutoML includes cybersecurity assessments alongside traditional safety tools.
The **Cyber Risk Assessment** view evaluates damage scenarios, threat
scenarios and attack vectors to compute overall impact, risk level and
Cybersecurity Assurance Level (CAL). Each row may reference a
`CybersecurityGoal`, which aggregates the highest CAL from its linked
risk assessments.

### Safety and Cyber Governance

The governance model below illustrates how safety and cybersecurity
activities converge during reviews.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A([Threat Analysis]) --> B([Cyber Risk Assessment])
    B --> C([Cybersecurity Goals])
    A --> D([Hazard Analysis])
    D --> E([Safety Goals])
    C & E --> F([Governance Review])
    F --> G([Mitigations Implemented])
```

Threat analyses feed cyber risk assessments and ultimately cybersecurity
goals, while hazard analyses inform safety goals. Both goal sets flow
into a combined governance review that drives the implementation of
mitigations across safety and security domains.

## Review Toolbox

Launch the review features from the **Review** menu:

* **Start Peer Review** – create at least one moderator and one reviewer, then tick the checkboxes for the FTAs and FMEAs you want to include. Each moderator and participant has an associated email address. A due date is requested and once reached the review becomes read‑only unless a moderator extends it. A document window opens showing the selected elements. FTAs are drawn on canvases you can drag and scroll, while FMEAs appear as full tables listing every field so failures can be reviewed line by line. Linked requirements are listed below and any text changes are colored the same way as other differences. Changes to which requirements are allocated to each item are highlighted in blue and red.
* **Start Joint Review** – add participants with reviewer or approver roles and at least one moderator, select the desired FTAs and FMEAs via checkboxes and enter a unique review name and description. Approvers can approve only after all reviewers are done and comments resolved. Moderators may edit the description, due date or participant list later from the toolbox. The document window behaves the same as for peer reviews with draggable FTAs and tabulated FMEAs. Requirement diffs are also shown in this view.
* Closing a joint review asks for a baseline name which is combined with the automatically incremented version, for example "v4 - baseline_00_98_23". This label appears in the **Compare Versions** dialog.
* **Open Review Toolbox** – manage comments. Selecting a comment focuses the related element and shows the text below the list. Use the **Open Document** button to reopen the visualization for the currently selected review. A drop-down at the top lists every saved review with its approval status.
* **Merge Review Comments** – combine feedback from another saved model into the current one so parallel reviews can be consolidated.
* **Compare Versions** – view earlier approved versions. Differences are listed with a short description and small before/after images of changed FTA nodes. Requirement allocations are compared in the diagrams and logs.
* **Set Current User** – choose who you are when adding comments. The toolbox also provides a drop-down selector.
* **Update Decomposition** – after splitting a requirement into two, select either child and use the new button in the node dialog to pick a different ASIL pair.
* The target selector within the toolbox only lists nodes and FMEA items that were chosen when the review was created, so comments can only be attached to the scoped elements.

Nodes with unresolved comments show a small yellow circle to help locate feedback quickly. When a review document is opened it automatically compares the current model to the previous approved version. Added elements appear in blue and removed ones in red just like the **Compare Versions** tool, but only for the FTAs and FMEAs included in that review.

When comparing versions, added nodes and connections are drawn in blue while removed ones are drawn in red. Text differences highlight deleted portions in red and new text in blue so changes to descriptions, rationales or FMEA fields stand out. Deleted links between FTA nodes are shown with red connectors. Requirement lists are compared as well so allocation changes show up alongside description and rationale edits. The Requirements Matrix window now lists every requirement with the nodes and FMEA items where it is allocated and the safety goals traced to each one.

Comments can be attached to FMEA entries and individual requirements. Resolving a comment prompts for a short explanation which is shown with the original text.

Review information (participants, comments, review names, descriptions and approval state) is saved as part of the model file and restored on load.

## Additional Tools

### Common Cause Toolbox

The **Common Cause Toolbox** groups failures that share the same cause across FMEAs, FMEDAs and FTAs. It highlights events that may lead to common cause failures and supports exporting the aggregated list to CSV.

### Risk & Assurance Gate Calculator

A built-in calculator derives a Prototype Assurance Level (PAL) from confidence, robustness and direct assurance inputs. Gates aggregate assurance from child nodes to help judge whether additional testing or design changes are needed before road trials.

### Product Goals Export

Use **Export Product Goal Requirements** in the Requirements menu to generate a CSV listing each product goal with its associated requirements and ASIL ratings.

### Safety Performance Indicators

The **Safety Performance Indicators** tool in the Safety & Security Management tab
aggregates each product goal's validation target and acceptance criteria with
its safety and AI metrics. Safety metrics such as SPFM, LPFM and DC, along with
AI-specific measures like false-negative or precision rates, can be compared
against the planned validation targets. This view highlights how acceptance
criteria translate into measurable indicators and whether current performance
meets the required safety objectives.

### Safety & Security Management Toolbox

The **Safety & Security Management Toolbox** lets you organize safety work products across the entire lifecycle. You can define phases, attach tailored work products from any diagram or analysis with a supporting rationale, and capture workflows that govern how these items interact. The resulting lifecycle and workflow definition can be exported as a JSON business diagram to document your safety governance process.

### Acceptance Criteria and Validation Targets

ISO 21448 provides a method to derive a validation target from an acceptance
criterion by analysing the rate of the hazardous behaviour :math:`R_{HB}`.
The **acceptance rate** :math:`A_H` represents the tolerated rate of harm
in events per hour. Product goals also record the operational hours spent in
the system's ON state for which the acceptance criterion applies. The derived
validation target is the corresponding rate of hazardous behaviour
:math:`R_{HB}` that should not be exceeded. A mission profile from the model
can be selected to define the operating context for this validation target. Given
conditional probabilities for exposure :math:`P_{E|HB}`, uncontrollability
:math:`P_{C|E}` and severity :math:`P_{S|C}`, the acceptable rate of the
hazardous behaviour is computed as:

```
R_HB = A_H / (P_{E|HB} * P_{C|E} * P_{S|C})
```

This value can serve as a validation target when planning tests. For example,
an acceptance criterion of ``1e-8/h`` with ``P_{E|HB}=0.05``,
``P_{C|E}=0.1`` and ``P_{S|C}=0.01`` yields ``R_HB = 2e-4/h``. Because the
conditional probabilities are often very small, even moderate acceptance
rates can produce seemingly large validation targets.

The product goal editor derives exposure, controllability and severity
probabilities from their risk assessment ratings and shows them as read-only
fields. Only the acceptance rate is editable; the validation target is then
computed automatically.

The following rule-of-thumb probabilities are used to convert ISO 26262/21448
ratings into conditional probabilities. Each step increases the likelihood by
roughly an order of magnitude and represents values commonly referenced in
industry practice:

| Rating | P(E\|HB) | P(C\|E) | P(S\|C) |
|-------:|----------:|---------:|---------:|
| 1      | 1×10⁻⁴    | 1×10⁻³   | 1×10⁻³   |
| 2      | 1×10⁻³    | 1×10⁻²   | 1×10⁻²   |
| 3      | 1×10⁻²    | 1×10⁻¹   | 1×10⁻¹   |
| 4      | 1×10⁻¹    | –        | –        |

Projects with empirical data may substitute more precise values, but these
approximations provide a justified starting point when none are available. The
probability associated with each rating can be adjusted under **Project
Properties → Validation Probabilities** and is persisted in the project's JSON
file.

These acceptance criteria and validation targets form the baseline for Safety
Performance Indicators. Observed safety or AI metrics are traced back to these
targets so stakeholders can validate whether the established acceptance
criteria are met throughout development and testing.

## Email Setup

When sending review summaries, the application asks for SMTP settings and login details. If you use Gmail with two-factor authentication enabled, create an **app password** and enter it instead of your normal account password. Authentication failures will prompt you to re-enter these settings.

Each summary email embeds PNG images showing the differences between the current model and the last approved version for the selected FTAs so reviewers can view the diagrams directly in the message. CSV files containing the FMEA tables are attached so they can be opened in Excel or another spreadsheet application. Requirement changes with allocations and safety goal traces are listed below the diagrams.

If sending fails with a connection error, the dialog will prompt again so you can correct the server address or port.

## Dependencies

AutoML relies on a few third‑party Python packages. The new
`automl.py` script checks for these dependencies and installs any that are
missing before handing off execution to `mainappsrc/automl_core.py`. The required packages
are:

```
Pillow openpyxl networkx reportlab adjustText
```

You can still install them manually with pip if preferred:

```
pip install pillow openpyxl networkx reportlab adjustText
```

When building the standalone executable with PyInstaller these packages must
already be available so they can be bundled into `AutoML.exe`. Missing
dependencies, such as Pillow, will otherwise lead to `ModuleNotFoundError`
when launching the built executable.

Note that Pillow provides the `PIL` module. The build scripts verify
dependencies with `python -m pip show` so the correct interpreter is used and
pass `--hidden-import=PIL.ImageTk` to PyInstaller to ensure the module is
bundled correctly.

If double‑clicking `mainappsrc/automl_core.py` closes immediately, launch it from a command
prompt instead so any error messages remain visible. Running `automl.py`
performs the dependency installation automatically:

```
python automl.py
```

## Metrics Tab

AutoML can display simple project metrics without needing Matplotlib. Open the
graphs via **View → Metrics**. Three canvases provide at‑a‑glance insight:

- **Requirement history** – line chart tracking the total number of
  requirements over time.
- **Status distribution** – bar chart showing counts for each requirement
  status such as *open* or *closed*.
- **User effort** – bar chart summarizing any values stored in
  ``app.user_metrics``.

Create requirements and populate their statuses to see data appear. Empty
projects will show blank charts until information is added.

## Diagram Styles

Several XML files in the `config/styles` directory control the colors used for
diagram elements. The default style `pastel.xml` provides softer tones like
peach actions and steel-blue nodes. `modern.xml` offers a Material-inspired
palette for a different look. Open the Style Editor via **View → Style Editor**, click **Load** and choose
the desired style. All open diagrams update immediately.

## Building the Executable
To create a standalone Windows executable with PyInstaller that embeds the
dependency-checking `automl.py`:

- **Linux/macOS:** run `bin/build_exe.sh`
- **Windows:** run `bin\build_exe.bat`

You can invoke these scripts from any directory; they locate the repository
root automatically. Both generate `AutoML.exe` and an installer archive `AutoML_installer.zip` inside the `bin` directory. After building you can launch the application directly or use
`bin/run_automl.sh` on Unix-like systems or `bin\run_automl.bat` on
Windows. The bundled executable executes `automl.py` internally so it
performs the same dependency installation when run from source.

The build scripts explicitly include Tkinter and its submodules so the GUI
launches correctly when running the packaged executable. This prevents
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'` errors on systems without a
full Python installation.

If a previous build failed and left an `AutoML.spec` file behind, the build
scripts now delete it before running PyInstaller so your command line
options are always applied.

The scripts exclude the `scipy` package, which is not required by AutoML but
can cause PyInstaller to fail on some Python installations. If you encounter
errors about ``IndexError`` while building, try upgrading your Python runtime
or reinstalling SciPy. This is most common when using a pre-release Python
interpreter (e.g. ``3.10.0rc2``). Install the latest stable release of Python
and run the build again if you hit this issue.

## Example Safety Analysis Tables

The following example shows how to build a small project from scratch so you can
follow the full safety workflow yourself. Start with these setup steps:

### Project Setup

1. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install pillow openpyxl networkx matplotlib reportlab adjustText
   ```
2. Launch AutoML with `python automl.py` and choose **File → New Project**.
3. Create an activity diagram named **Stop at Intersection**:
   - **Diagram → Activity → New**
   - Add an initial node, an action called *Braking*, and a final node.
   - Save the diagram. HAZOP entries reference actions from activity diagrams,
     so the HAZOP table cannot be created without this step.
4. Add a scenario library via **Libraries → Scenario Library** and create the
   *Detroit* library with a scenario named *Pedestrians crossing* (exposure 4).

With the project prepared, the following sections illustrate each analysis.

### HAZOP

Steps to reproduce:
1. Navigate to **Safety → HAZOP**.
2. Click **Add Entry** and fill in the fields as shown.
3. Save the document.

| Function | Malfunction | Scenario | Hazard | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Stop at Intersection | Does not stop at intersection | Pedestrians crossing | Run over VRUs | If the vehicle fails to stop when pedestrians are crossing, it may run over vulnerable road users. |

### Risk Assessment

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open **Safety → Risk Assessment** and create a new document linked to the HAZOP entry.
2. Set Severity = 3, Controllability = 3, Exposure = 4; AutoML computes ASIL D.
3. Export or save to view the table.

| Malfunction | Hazard | Scenario | Severity | Controllability | Exposure | ASIL | Safety Goal |
|-------------|--------|----------|----------|----------------|----------|------|-------------|
| Does not stop at intersection | Run over VRUs | Pedestrians crossing | 3 | 3 | 4 | D | Prevent no braking |

### Fault Tree

Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to **Analysis → Fault Tree**.
2. Create the top event "Prevent no braking" with an AND gate.
3. Add basic events for "capacitor is open" and "capacitor is shorted".
4. Run the probability calculation.

| Node | Type | Description | Probability | Safety Goal |
|------|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Prevent no braking | TOP EVENT (AND) | Does not stop at intersection | 0.01277 | Prevent no braking |
| Node 5 | Basic Event | capacitor is open | 0.09227 | Prevent no braking |
| Node 8 | Basic Event | capacitor is shorted | 0.13841 | Prevent no braking |

### FMEDA

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open **Safety → FMEDA** and create a document named "ADS_FMEDA".
2. Add failure modes with diagnostic coverage and FIT values.
3. AutoML computes SPFM and LPFM; export the table.

| ID | Description | FMEA Cause | Malfunction | Safety Goal | Fault Type | FIT | SPFM | LPFM | Diagnostic Cov. |
|----|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|-----|------|------|-----------------|
| 4 | open | capacitor is open | Does not stop at intersection | Prevent no braking | permanent | 3844.68 | 38.4468 | 0 | 0.99 |
| 6 | shorted | capacitor is shorted | — | — | transient | 5767.02 | 0 | 1441.755 | 0.75 |

### Reliability Analysis

Steps to reproduce:
1. Navigate to **Analysis → Reliability** and create an "ADS_BOM" analysis.
2. Add components with their quantity and attributes.
3. Run the FIT calculation and export the results.

| Component | Type | Qty | FIT |
|-----------|------|-----|-----|
| resistor | resistor | 20 | 297.505 |
| capacitor | capacitor | 10 | 961.17 |

### Causal Bayesian Network

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open **Safety → Causal Bayesian Network** and create a document named "CBN".
2. Add variables `Rain`, `WetGround` and `SlipperyRoad` linking them in that order.
3. Set probabilities:
   - `Rain` prior 0.3
   - `WetGround` | `Rain` = 0.9, `¬Rain` = 0.1
   - `SlipperyRoad` | `WetGround` = 0.8, `¬WetGround` = 0.05
4. Use **Query** for `SlipperyRoad` to obtain approximately 0.305.

This end-to-end flow links HAZOP findings to risk assessment ratings, fault trees, FMEDA metrics, reliability data and causal Bayesian network reasoning for a coherent safety & security case.
