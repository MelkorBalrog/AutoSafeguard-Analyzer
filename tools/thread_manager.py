"""Basic thread monitoring and recovery utilities.

The :class:`ThreadManager` keeps track of registered threads and uses a
background :class:`ThreadMonitor` to ensure they remain alive.  If a
thread terminates unexpectedly it will be restarted using the original
callable and arguments.  This lightweight approach helps keep the tool in
sync and improves overall robustness.
